# Kew Project

To take on this tricky job, a solution needed to be found to dig the swimming pool with only 1m access onto the site. Fences were unable to be pulled down as this property in Kew already had established neighbouring lots. Despite the circumstances and working by the concept "where there is a will, there is a way", a 900mm retractable machine and motorized wheelbarrow were used to excavate the swimming pool.

## Project Overview

The most obvious design feature of this swimming pool is its circular shape – a rare design that can only be achieved with a concrete structure. Combined with a sparkling light blue glass pebble interior, this design is the perfect counterpart to the existing natural landscape that free flows around the pool.

## Key Features

- Unique circular design
- Light blue glass pebble interior
- Curved external swimout (2m x 500mm)
- Automatic heat pump
- Water and chemical management system
- Underwater LED multicolour lighting
- Hidden filtration equipment in nearby shed
- 4m diameter with 1.7m flat depth

## Design Process

Extra manpower was required to manually assist with this dig, ensuring that this job was completed at an efficient pace and was kept to the construction timeframe. At the furthest end of the pool, a curved external swimout (2m x 500mm) doubles as the pool entry. This was intentionally positioned to directly face the prominent garden vicinity – perfect for the owners to sit back and enjoy the view of their private oasis.

## Results

The completed project won the 2019 SPASA Victoria Gold Award for Best Residential Concrete Pool Under $60,000. The circular design creates a stunning focal point in the garden, while the integrated features ensure easy maintenance and enjoyment. This swimming pool is ideal for the owners to plunge in on a warm and sunny Melbourne day.
