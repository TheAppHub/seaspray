A custom-built 4m circular concrete plunge pool in Kew, designed to complement an established garden oasis despite challenging site access.

## Project Overview

Tucked within a mature residential block in Kew, this distinctive round concrete pool is a rare gem. Limited to only 1m site access due to neighbouring properties, Seaspray’s team devised an innovative solution, using a 900mm retractable excavator and motorised wheelbarrow — with extra manpower — to complete the dig efficiently and on schedule.


## Design Process

The pool’s standout circular shape showcases the versatility of concrete construction, blending naturally with the flowing garden landscape. Finished in a sparkling light blue glass pebble interior, it reflects sunlight beautifully. At the far end, a curved external swimout (2m x 500mm) serves as both an entry point and a tranquil seat facing the lush garden.

## Results

The completed project won the 2019 SPASA Victoria Gold Award for Best Residential Concrete Pool Under $60,000. The circular design creates a stunning focal point in the garden, while the integrated features ensure easy maintenance and enjoyment. This swimming pool is ideal for the owners to plunge in on a warm and sunny Melbourne day.
