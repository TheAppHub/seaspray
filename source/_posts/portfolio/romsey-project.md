# Romsey Project

With the intention being a combination of both exercise and family fun, this impressive 15m x 5m swimming pool completely fit the brief. A pool of this size has plenty of freedom in design, which allowed the owners to include exciting elements such as the external fully tiled spa and raised sheerface water feature.

## Project Overview

It only made sense that a pool this big would have a depth of almost two meters at its deepest point â€“ a prime requirement made by the kids. To assist with these young swimmers, a shallow ledge runs along the full length of the pool, being both a safety feature and playful component in this design.

## Key Features

- Large 15m x 5m swimming pool
- External fully tiled spa
- Raised sheerface water feature
- Shallow ledge along full length
- Water and chemical management system
- LED multicolour lighting
- Smooth rendered interior
- Waterline tiles
- Solar and gas heating

## Design Process

Due to the slight slope of land, the pool was built to be partially out of ground at the rear point. This raised the opportunity to create a multilevel backyard, which adds a little bit of texture to the wide-open space. And perhaps the most extraordinary aspect is that from the pool you can see panoramic views of the farmland, a truly breathtaking feature that is hard to beat.

## Results

The long stretch of bright blue water, teamed with travertine paving, timber decking and a rural farm-like pool barrier, offers a unique country touch to this overall design. This incredible project was, and still is, a true masterpiece that perfectly balances functionality with aesthetic appeal.
