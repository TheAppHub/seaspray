A spacious 15m x 5m custom concrete pool and spa in Romsey, designed for both family fun and lap swimming, complete with a raised water feature and sweeping rural views.

## Project Overview

This impressive 15-metre custom concrete pool was designed to balance daily exercise and family leisure time. With ample room for swimming laps, playing games, and relaxing, the pool sits beautifully within a gently sloping block, creating a multi-level backyard that feels open yet textured.


## Design Process

To meet the owners’ vision, Seaspray crafted a pool with a depth nearing two metres at its deepest point — a must-have for the kids. A shallow ledge runs the full length, providing a safe space for younger swimmers and a spot to rest or play. An adjoining fully tiled spa and a raised sheerface water feature add visual interest and resort-style appeal.

## Results

The partly out-of-ground structure maximises views of the surrounding farmland, offering a true country escape. Finished with bright blue water, travertine paving, timber decking, and a rural-inspired pool fence, this design perfectly blends elegance with a rustic touch. A sophisticated water and chemical management system, LED multicolour lighting, waterline tiles, solar and gas heating, and a smooth rendered interior ensure year-round comfort and ease of care.
