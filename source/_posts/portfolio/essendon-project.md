A custom-designed concrete pool and spa maximising a compact backyard space in Essendon, with architectural tiling and a striking rain drop waterfall feature.

## Project Overview

Positioned along the property boundary, this concrete pool and spa transform a narrow backyard into a functional, elegant outdoor retreat. Frameless glass fencing keeps the area secure while preserving clear sightlines to the water, adding safety without compromising style.


## Design Process
To achieve the seamless look, Seaspray engineered thicker-than-standard pool walls so the fully tiled interior extends beyond the waterline into the surrounding block walls. Custom glass blue mosaics add depth and a touch of artistry, replacing plain render with a sophisticated finish. Every detail was considered to blend the pool with the home’s modern architecture.

## Results

A subtle rain drop waterfall installed in the roof truss creates a serene curtain of water in front of the dining window — an eye-catching feature from indoors and out. Despite the tight space, the pool and spa feel open and welcoming, providing a private oasis and showcasing Seaspray’s skill in compact luxury pool design.
