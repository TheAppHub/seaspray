Located in Brighton East, Sundrenched Waters is a custom-designed concrete swimming pool created to support relaxed family living while maintaining a refined architectural presence. The design centres around a rectangular pool paired with an offset raised spa and cascading spillway, adding movement and a subtle sensory element without overwhelming the space.

## Project Overview

The homeowners sought a pool that was visually warm, accessible for multiple generations, and comfortable to use throughout the year. A gentle entry and generous spa zone were key considerations, ensuring the pool could be enjoyed by children, adults, and elderly family members alike.

The project presented several site challenges, including limited access after the home was completed, non-parallel boundaries, and a required level change between the house and pool zone. Through detailed planning and coordination, excavation and landscaping works were carefully staged alongside pool construction to minimise disruption and maintain efficiency.

Material selection played a critical role in achieving the desired outcome. The fully tiled Peppercorn finish was chosen for its ability to create depth and warmth in the water colour, while external finishes to the raised spa were integrated with the surrounding landscape to ensure a cohesive overall design.

## Results

The result is a highly functional, visually balanced outdoor retreat that enhances the home’s architecture and provides a timeless, low-maintenance pool solution tailored to the client’s lifestyle.
