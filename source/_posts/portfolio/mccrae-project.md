Set along the coast, this stunning pool and spa were inspired by the relaxed beauty of McCrae beach. With soft sandy paving, vibrant blue tiling, and a soothing water feature, it captures that perfect holiday feeling right at home. Designed for easy living, the pool is equipped with smart automation and low-maintenance systems so it’s always ready to dive in.

## Project Overview

The pool’s shape curves gracefully around the home, fitting naturally into the sloping land. Raised retaining walls create a smooth step down from the outdoor entertaining area to the water’s edge, while carefully placed water returns and lighting make sure the pool stays warm and inviting long after sunset.

Getting everything in place wasn’t without its challenges. Access was tight, a narrow cobblestone driveway meant only small machinery could get through, and materials had to be moved carefully across multiple levels. With the pool excavation blocking the only yard access, landscaping and other site work had to be managed alongside construction. Thanks to thorough planning and smart construction equipment, our team navigated these hurdles smoothly, keeping the site safe and efficient.

The end result is a beautiful, one of a kind, custom pool and spa that blend seamlessly with the home and surroundings, inviting everyone to relax, unwind, and enjoy the outdoor lifestyle all year round.
