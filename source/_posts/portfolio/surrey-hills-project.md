A beautifully engineered custom concrete pool with elevated spa in Surrey Hills, designed for a sloping block and crafted to be the focal point of a split-level backyard.

## Project Overview

This striking concrete swimming pool in Surrey Hills was purpose-built for a challenging sloped site. Engineered to sit almost entirely out of ground, the pool’s formwork on all sides ensured maximum use of the available space. Positioned at the base of the backyard, its length aligns perfectly with the home’s width, creating a seamless flow from house to pool.


## Design Process

The staggered, split-level landscape makes the pool area visible from the home’s living spaces, naturally drawing the eye to this urban oasis. Within the pool zone, the raised spa appears to float above the main pool, with a gentle waterfall cascading over a cornered tiled spillway — a detail that enhances the sense of layered luxury.

## Results

The completed project won the 2018 SPASA Victoria Gold Award for Best Residential Concrete Pool Under $50,000. The whitewashed deck, vintage red bricks, and twilight hues in the pool creates a rustic and trendy ambience. The most unique feature of this design is having a selection of bluestone paving tiles underwater, which were laid along the ledge, steps, and seated areas in the spa, not only being a contemporary visual aspect but ensuring these areas are smooth to touch for many years to come.
