A secluded 25m custom concrete lap pool in St Andrews, thoughtfully built into a bushland sanctuary and winner of multiple SPASA Awards for design and excellence.


## Project Overview

This award-winning custom concrete swimming pool sits within its own private retreat, surrounded by tranquil bushland and the propertyâ€™s home-grown vineyard. Hidden from roads and neighbours, the design maximises seclusion and connection with nature, creating an idyllic space for daily swimming and relaxation.


## Design Process

Constructed on a sheer cliff face, this steep site demanded innovative engineering. The 25-metre pool shell was precisely cut into the embankment, with formwork stabilising three sides against the slope. A ledge at each end provides rest points for laps, while broad steps at the deep end ensure easy access and exit.

## Results

At the shallow end, a concealed tank houses an automatic Remco pool cover neatly hidden beneath the deck for safety and effortless maintenance. Solar and electric heating, an advanced water and chemical management system, LED multicolour lighting, and a dark blue fully tiled interior with a crisp white lap lane combine to create a premium swimming experience, year-round. This pool was proudly awarded the SPASA Australia Pool of the Year and SPASA Victoria Gold Award for Best Residential Concrete Pool under $100,000.
