This project truly was our proudest achievement! Seaspray Pools were honoured to receive the SPASA Australia Pool of the Year Award in 2014, alongside SPASA Victoria Gold Award for Best Residential Concrete Pool â€“ Under $100,000 and Highly Commended for Best Residential Concrete Lap Pool.

## Project Overview

This swimming pool situates within its very own private sanctuary. Located in a secluded area, the swimming pool has little distraction as it is immersed in a tranquil bushland setting. There is no view of the road or neighbouring homes, only the most serene site of the home-grown vineyard to admire every day.

## Key Features

- 25m lap pool 'retreat' designed for fitness purposes
- Rest ledges at both ends for comfortable breaks
- Steps at the deep end for easy access and exit
- Automatic Remco pool cover completely concealed by the deck
- Solar and electric heating for all year-round swimming
- Water and chemical management system
- LED multicolour lighting
- Dark blue fully tiled interior with highlighted white tiled lap lane

## Design Process

This extremely steep site presented many challenges throughout the construction. Designed on a sheer cliff face, the shape of the swimming pool had to be cut into the embankment. Formwork was required around three sides of the pool to stabilize the concrete shell against the precipice.

## Results

The completed project exceeded all expectations, creating a stunning outdoor space that combines functionality with aesthetic appeal. The design creates a dramatic effect against the natural landscape, while the integrated features ensure easy maintenance and enjoyment. The awards received are a testament to the quality and innovation of this exceptional project.
