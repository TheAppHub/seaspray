A stunning modern concrete swimming pool project in Elsternwick, designed to create a luxurious outdoor living space that complements the contemporary architecture of the home.

## Project Overview

Located in Melbourne’s inner south-east, this Elsternwick backyard was transformed into a serene poolside retreat. The brief focused on balancing visual impact with practicality — delivering a beautiful, low-maintenance space that could be enjoyed year-round. The pool design incorporates family-focused features, energy-efficient systems, and seamless integration with the existing landscape.


## Design Process

Our team worked closely with the client to understand their vision and requirements. The design process included:

1. Initial consultation and site assessment
2. Concept development and 3D visualisation
3. Detailed design and engineering
4. Construction and installation

## Results

The final result is a calm, elegant backyard space that invites relaxation and connection. With its soft aqua tones and premium finish, this Elsternwick pool has become the centrepiece of the home — a place to swim, unwind, and create lasting memories with family.
