This pool was designed for a family who wanted their backyard to feel like an extension of the landscape, not a separate space. Tucked into the slope and overlooking sweeping valley views, the design flows naturally with the land’s contours. The water’s soft grey-green hue blends seamlessly with the surrounding trees and stonework, creating a calm, earthy atmosphere that feels both grounded and luxurious.

## Project Overview

Every detail was planned to make pool ownership effortless. With smart automation, the family can heat the spa, set the lights, or tweak the water temperature from their phone. Hidden systems like the in-floor cleaning and automatic cover keep everything pristine with minimal fuss, so they can spend more time swimming and less time maintaining.

Designed with a young family in mind, this pool is as functional as it is beautiful. The wide beach entry is perfect for little feet and lazy lounging, while the deep end and seating ledge invite endless games and relaxed afternoons. The built-in spa, with its eight venturi jets, adds a resort-style touch for evenings under the stars, pure bliss after a long day.

Behind the scenes, this pool is an engineering marvel. Built into a challenging slope with limited access, it required serious craftsmanship to bring the vision to life. But what makes it truly special isn’t the complexity, it’s how simple it feels once you step into it. From sunrise swims to nighttime dips beneath glowing lights, this pool isn’t just part of the backyard, it is the backyard’s heart.
