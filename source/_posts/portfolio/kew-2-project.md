Set on a beautiful sloping block, this elevated pool makes the most of its surroundings while maintaining a clean, cohesive connection to the outdoor entertaining areas. The design offers a light, inviting water colour and year-round usability, creating a space that feels as good as it looks.

## Project Overview

Built on a challenging slope, the project required careful planning to ensure the pool sat perfectly level with the home and outdoor spaces without the need for excessive excavation or retaining walls. The result is an elevated structure that feels effortless, blending seamlessly with the natural contours of the land.

Every element was thoughtfully considered, from the soft, calming water tones that reflect the surrounding landscape to the in-floor cleaning system that keeps maintenance to a minimum. Heating was also extended for year-round comfort, so the pool can be enjoyed through every season.

The end result is a perfect balance of style, comfort, and practicality, a pool that not only enhances the view but elevates the entire outdoor experience.
