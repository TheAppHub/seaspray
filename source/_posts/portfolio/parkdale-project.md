This luxurious pool was designed with family in mind. A generously sized spa, a beautiful glass tiled interior that mirrors the calming colours of the nearby beach, and a large shallow area perfect for sun lounges. Every detail was created to blend relaxation and style with the added convenience of an automated pool cover to keep it protected and ready for use year-round.

## Project Overview

Working closely with the clients and architects, the focus was on combining functionality, easy maintenance, and extended swim seasons to create an inviting outdoor space that everyone could enjoy together.

One unique challenge was building the pool before the house. This meant careful coordination to make sure the pool fit seamlessly into the future property layout. Site access and landscaping plans had to be carefully managed to work around the pool as the rest of the home took shape.

A real standout feature is the automated pool cover, spanning nearly 10 meters in length. This innovative system is designed as a single seamless piece that hides completely out of sight when retracted thanks to a specially built holding tank running the length of the pool. Unlike typical covers that roll across the width, this cover keeps the pool area looking sleek and uncluttered while offering effortless protection at the push of a button.

Designed to fit beautifully with its beachside surroundings and modern home, the pool’s colour palette and shape were carefully chosen to feel like a natural extension of the coastal landscape making the whole outdoor space feel connected, calm, and inviting.
