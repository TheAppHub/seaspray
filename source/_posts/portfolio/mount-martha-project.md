A stunning 12m x 3m custom concrete pool and mini spa in Mount Martha, designed for uninterrupted ocean views and effortless coastal living.

## Project Overview

Welcome to this oceanfront retreat, where luxury and leisure meet the calming coastal scenery. Just steps from sandy shores, this 12-metre pool was positioned to face the ocean, inviting swimmers to soak up panoramic views while enjoying a swim or soak.


## Design Process

Every element was chosen to harmonise with the surroundings. Matching pool tiles mirror the ocean’s blue tones, while warm sandstone paving brings natural beach vibes poolside — no need to step away to feel the coastal atmosphere. Cleverly built partially above ground, the pool’s design removes the need for fencing on exposed sides, keeping sightlines open and uninterrupted.

## Results

More than a statement piece, this pool is designed for easy care and year-round enjoyment. A fully tiled interior, advanced sanitation system, infloor cleaning, automatic water leveller and an inviting mini spa with three Venturi jets deliver both luxury and convenience. Whether for swimming laps, relaxing in the spa or simply taking in the view, this oceanfront oasis is the ultimate coastal escape.
