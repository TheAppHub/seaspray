A bold and innovative plunge pool in Essendon, cleverly designed for tight spaces with an acrylic viewing window, hidden swim cover and year-round comfort.

## Project Overview

This compact plunge pool proves that clever vertical design can transform a tight urban space into a luxurious escape. The client’s vision was clear: a pool that defies limited space yet delivers maximum enjoyment. The result is a stunning, feature-packed retreat that feels anything but small.


## Design Process

One of the standout features is the acrylic window — integrated directly into both the pool wall and fencing — offering a unique underwater view while serving as a fully compliant, seamless pool barrier. Equally innovative is the hidden Remco Swimroll cover, neatly tucked inside a sleek stainless-steel housing within the pool ledge, keeping debris out and warmth in with minimal visual impact.

## Results

Designed for both relaxation and deeper plunges, the pool maintains a flat depth of 1.7 metres. It’s fully automated and practically zero-maintenance, with multiple heating options, an automatic water leveller, ozone sanitation and the crystal-clear acrylic panel adding a touch of chic elegance. This Essendon plunge pool redefines what a modern urban pool can be — smart, stylish and refreshingly different.
