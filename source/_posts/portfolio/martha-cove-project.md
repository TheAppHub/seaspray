A 10m x 3.8m custom concrete pool designed alongside a new seaside holiday home in Martha Cove, blending elevated structure and chic finishes to maximise panoramic marina views.

## Project Overview

Designed in tandem with the build of the new home, this custom concrete swimming pool at Martha Cove transforms the backyard into a showpiece. The site was excavated one level lower, creating the impression that the house and pool sit elevated, enhancing the marina outlook. This out-of-ground pool design also eliminates the need for a perimeter pool fence on the exposed sides, keeping the serene coastal vista unobstructed.


## Design Process

To maintain water quality, the pool uses an advanced automatic water management system and a discreet automatic pool cover. At the touch of a button, the cover glides out from a submerged recess below the swim area, preserving valuable space and providing safety and efficiency.

## Results

Positioned in the corner of the property to capture sweeping views, this 10m x 3.8m pool is finished with sleek black mosaic waterline tiles and bold dark grout for a contemporary edge. LED multicolour lighting, a large electric heat pump, and a chemical management system ensure easy upkeep and year-round comfort. The exterior silver travertine detailing ties the design seamlessly to the modern charm of the home and its stunning seaside setting.
