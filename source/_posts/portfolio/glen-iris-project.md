A striking custom concrete pool and spa perched high above ground in Glen Iris, designed for year-round resort-style relaxation and stunning views from the heart of the home.

## Project Overview

This eye-catching pool and spa combination was crafted to become the centrepiece of this Glen Iris home. Elevated where an old retaining wall once stood, it’s perfectly positioned to be admired from the kitchen and living areas, turning everyday living into a luxury escape.


## Design Process

The pool’s centre-depth layout features symmetrical ledges and steps at each end, providing easy, welcoming entry points for swimmers of all ages. The interior finish, with 23mm blended ‘Seaspray’ tiles, evokes a tropical retreat feel and shimmers beautifully year-round.

## Results

With creative access solutions and smart landscaping, Seaspray maximised the available space without compromise. Multiple heating sources, an infloor cleaning system and full automation ensure stress-free pool care. Multi-coloured LED lights transform the pool at night, while the separate spa offers a cosy, fireplace-like warmth — the perfect spot to unwind, no matter the season.
