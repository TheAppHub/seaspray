A modern concrete pool designed to complement contemporary landscaping, creating a luxurious outdoor sanctuary for family living in Melbourne’s leafy south-east.

## Project Overview

This bespoke swimming pool in Lysterfield integrates crisp architectural lines with lush garden elements to echo the home’s modern aesthetic. Surrounded by frameless glass fencing, the pool area maintains uninterrupted views while enhancing safety and style. Strategically placed timber posts soften the boundary, complemented by elegant planting and subtle under-lighting to create an inviting atmosphere by day and night.


## Design Process

The design phase focused on harmonising the pool with the property’s building envelope and expansive backyard. Meticulous planning ensured the pool’s placement aligned with the dining area’s sightlines, offering seamless indoor-outdoor flow without compromising garden space. Seaspray’s collaborative approach balanced functional family features with a striking visual presence that elevates the entire landscape.

## Results

The result is a sophisticated backyard centrepiece that delivers year-round enjoyment for the entire family. Illuminated by energy-efficient LED lighting, the fully tiled deep blue mosaic interior shimmers beautifully against natural travertine paving. A stainless-steel triple-flow cascade creates soothing sounds and playful interaction for children. Additional features such as a shallow beach entry and relaxing venturi jets add comfort and resort-style appeal to everyday living.
