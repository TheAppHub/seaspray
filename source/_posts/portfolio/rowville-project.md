# Rowville Project

The finished result of this pool certainly demonstrates what can be achieved in a confined space. The original brief for this design was to create a family friendly swimming pool to integrate with the profile of the house and compliment the space available.

## Project Overview

Access was constricted and the limited pool area made the excavation difficult, however clever positioning of machinery and equipment ensured that the mess was minimized during soil removal. Approved Protection Works Notices were required to get the building permit issued as the pool was positioned adjacent to the side boundary of the property.

## Key Features

- Family-friendly design
- Water and chemical management system
- LED multicolour lighting
- Smooth rendered interior
- Waterline tiles
- Solar heating
- Integrated with Cornerstone Paving landscaping

## Design Process

The design process focused on maximizing the available space while ensuring the pool would be safe and enjoyable for the whole family. The construction team worked carefully to minimize disruption to the surrounding area and ensure the pool would integrate seamlessly with the existing landscape.

## Results

The completed project demonstrates how a well-designed pool can transform even the most challenging spaces. The family-friendly features and careful integration with the surrounding landscape create a perfect outdoor living space that will be enjoyed for years to come.
