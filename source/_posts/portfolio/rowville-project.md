A thoughtfully designed custom concrete pool in Rowville, maximising a confined backyard space with family-friendly features and a subtle, standout shape.

## Project Overview

This project is proof that a luxurious swimming pool can be achieved even in a tight suburban block. The brief was to create a family-friendly pool that integrated naturally with the home’s profile while making the most of the available space. Despite restricted access and a narrow footprint, careful planning and machinery positioning kept excavation neat and efficient.


## Design Process

Positioned close to the side boundary, the pool required approved Protection Works Notices to secure building permits. This strategic placement made it possible to gain up to four metres of swim width, balancing generous swimming space with enough backyard left for entertaining and landscaping.

## Results

A modern, contemporary feel is enhanced by LED multicolour lighting, solar heating, an automatic water leveller, a robotic cleaner, smooth rendered interior and crisp waterline tiles. Three built-in concrete stools in the shallow end blend seamlessly with the main entertaining area, while a smartly extended corner step creates a cosy nook. A 500mm ledge at the deep end doubles as a convenient entry, exit and play zone. The subtle bend in the pool’s irregular shape makes this design unique, adding personality to a compact yard.
