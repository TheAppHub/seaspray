Set within the rolling hills of Harkaway, Hi-Tech Horizons is a large-scale custom concrete pool designed to maximise expansive views while delivering a highly functional, technology-driven outdoor space for a multi-generational family.

## Project Overview

The design features a rectangular pool with an internal spa, beach entry, and a three-sided negative edge, allowing the waterline to visually merge with the surrounding landscape. The pool is positioned to be visible from multiple areas of the home, strengthening the connection between indoor and outdoor living spaces.

Family use was a central consideration throughout the design. A generous beach area provides a safe and accessible space for grandchildren, while the internal spa offers a dedicated relaxation zone for adults. The inclusion of a SwimJet system enables continuous swimming without compromising the pool’s layout or visual balance.

Given the scale and complexity of the project, careful planning was required to integrate multiple features, including the negative edge, automated cover, SwimJet system, lighting, and heating infrastructure, into a single cohesive design. The pool is fully automated, with integrated lighting and environmental controls, and connects to the home’s hydronic heating system to support year-round use.

## Results

The result is a visually striking yet highly practical swimming pool that responds to its landscape, supports a wide range of uses, and reflects a considered balance of design, technology, and long-term functionality.
