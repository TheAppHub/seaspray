## As a family-run business for over 30 years, we know a thing (or three) about pool building for Melbourne's unique climate.

We're proud of our reputation for outstanding custom designs, spectacular landscape design options, and unrivalled customer service.

It's why we're the number one, award-winning custom pool builder in Melbourne, year on year.

### Extensive experience.

At Seaspray Pools, we believe in building excellent relationships with our customers. Our expert team of three registered builders and an in-house landscape architect and designer will work closely with you to create a look you'll love. We also ensure that we provide affordable prices and personalised service from all our friendly staff for the entire process of your project.

### Fun in the sun all summer long.

There's few things more thrilling than adding a pool to your home. There's the prospect of fun get-togethers when the mercury rises, relaxing poolside friends and family, and beating the summer heat in style.

Done well, the right pool can add value to your property and increase the beauty of your spaces. It can keep your family fit and active and help you recharge after a long week at work. It's one of the best lifestyle decisions you can make.

### The Seaspray difference.

Deciding how your pool fits seamlessly into your existing space is also exciting. And when it comes to customising your pool to match your home's surrounds, we can't be beat.

We think your pool should be everything you want and more. Choose from our extensive range of options; in-ground or above-ground, indoor or outdoor, lap pool or spa pool â€“ you're only limited by your imagination.

We'll then work closely with you to create the pool of your dreams, following your exact design and specifications down to the letter. We can also customise a pool to meet your budget, making the entire process easy from start to finish.

Plus, you get added peace of mind knowing it's both tailored to your needs and engineered to last.
