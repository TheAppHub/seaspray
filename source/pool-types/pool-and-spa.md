## Custom Pool and Spa Designs for Everyday Luxury

A custom pool and spa combination brings together the best of both worlds - the fitness and fun of a swimming pool with the calm, therapeutic benefits of a spa. At Seaspray Pools, we design integrated solutions tailored to your lifestyle and home.

Whether you’re entertaining friends, relaxing after work, or giving the kids a space to enjoy, our designs deliver comfort, elegance and flexibility - all year round. Every detail is carefully considered, from integrated heating and lighting to cohesive tiling that brings the entire space together.

### Why integrate your spa into the pool design?

An integrated spa not only saves space, it also enhances usability and overall flow. Rather than separate systems or disconnected areas, we create a complete experience. Shared heating and filtration systems keep things simple and seamless, both in use and appearance.

### Popular pool & spa designs:

#### Side-by-side spa and pool designs

Clean and simple, with a clear divide and matching finishes. Easy to access, heat and enjoy throughout the year.

#### Raised spa with spillover edge

Add a striking visual feature with a spa that gently cascades into the main pool - combining beauty, sound and movement.
