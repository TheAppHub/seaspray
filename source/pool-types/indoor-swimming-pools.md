      You won't need to spend as much on heating costs because you can control the climate more readily and they hold heat more efficiently (adding a solar heater will save you even more). It's easier to keep an indoor swimming pool clean so you'll spend less on pool chemicals.

## We can make that dream happen

Picture your life with an indoor swimming pool at home.

A home indoor swimming pool is the last word in luxury. If you love being in the water, it's the ultimate way to stay fit, cool and protected from the hot Melbourne sun (or cold Melbourne winters)â€”plus you'll be the envy of all your friends!

Just imagine having a private oasis you can visit any time of the day or night. We can design and build an indoor swimming pool that perfectly matches your home's interior style, creating the ideal indoor-outdoor lifestyle experience.

### How can I make my indoor swimming pool design unique?

There's so many ways you can personalise your indoor pool design. Add a spa suite for relaxing after a busy day at work, install floor to ceiling windows to bring the outdoors in and loads of natural sunlight, or add a water feature and natural landscape design for that getaway island feel.

### Other options include:

#### Formal indoor swimming pool designs.

Timeless geometric shapes complement contemporary homes best. Classical good looks add eye-catching structure and symmetry to modern interior spaces, such as a rectangle or square.

#### Natural indoor swimming pool designs.

No harmful chlorine or chemicals added means you can swim free in clean, natural water as nature intended. Blend the pool design with indoor landscape design to create a private grotto you'll love spending time in.
