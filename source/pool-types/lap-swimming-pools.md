      Long, slender lap pools are perfect for smaller spaces – indoors or outdoors – and great if the thought of sharing the local community pool with hundreds of others makes you cringe. A lap pool's proportions work beautifully in Melbourne's compact inner-city gardens where a full-sized pool might be out of the question.
  - title: Health Benefits

      You'll get a pleasant, relaxing, joint-friendly workout without having to leave home and hit the gym. Swimming regularly is great for flexibility, posture, and keeps your heart rate up without stressing your body. Doing laps builds endurance, muscle strength and cardiovascular fitness while toning your muscles.

      You can swim for fitness at any age – it's great exercise for everyone from toddlers to pensioners. Keep down your weight effortlessly – swimming uses all your muscles for an all-over body workout.

## We design and build the most stylish lap pools in Melbourne.

Get fit and look fabulous at home with a lap pool.

Whether for fitness or a refreshing dip on a hot day, our customised lap pools for the Melbourne climate will enliven your daily routine and bring your family fun and fitness for years to come.

### Design a lap pool for Melbourne's unique architecture and climate.

When designing your lap pool, you should consider how it can enhance your property and lifestyle. A one-off concrete design can give you the flexibility to shape your lap pool to fit your outdoor living area—and we can help you design the right size and length to give you maximum enjoyment at a price you can afford.

If you've got a particularly tight space, you can always maximise your workout with a smaller lap pool by adding a high-flow swim jet to deliver multilevel resistance for a high-impact swim station.

### While our lap pools are certainly gorgeous to look at, most of our customers install them for fitness purposes. And, when studies show swimming decreases anxiety and improves mood, who can blame them?

### Our custom lap pools are ideal for small Melbourne backyards.

We can customise the ideal lap pool for your backyard or indoor area. Once you install one, it's guaranteed to deliver endless hours of recreation, health benefits and relaxation.
